# Phillie-s-Flowers
Phillie’s Flowers Online Ordering Philomena Hartigan has a flower shop. While her main business is flowers for weddings, funerals and Valentine’s day, she also has casual business as people buy for birthdays, anniversaries and other special occasions. She has attempted to maximise profits by upselling add-on items like teddy bears and chocolates. She offers pre-specified special packages containing set bouquets of flowers and add-on items like cards and chocolates. As her business has grown, her ability to run her business over the phone has led to growing pains. She now needs to automate as much of the process as possible by leveraging the web. She has no intention of managing her own infrastructure and has outsourced this to you. You must build a web application for her that allows customers order either custom gift packages (where the customer chooses the make-up of a bouquet and selects chocolates and other toys, etc.) or pre-set packages that can be ordered as a single item, including Valentine’s day packages. At this point she doesn’t consider it appropriate to allow for wedding and funeral flowers to be ordered online as this would miss the personal touch required.

# Backend
<br />
A Dutch supplier has a REST-based API that provides information to florists, such as flower
pricing, availability, as well as information on previous orders made by florists (including
whether there is a balance outstanding). You are to include a dashboard on the Phillie’s
Flowers web-site backend that provides this information from the supplier as well as an
overview of how the shop is doing (just headline figures such as total number of orders, total
revenue and best-selling packages).
